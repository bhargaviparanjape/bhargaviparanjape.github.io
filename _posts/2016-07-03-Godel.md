title: Finding anagrams using Gödel numbering and Randomization

This post is about a neat application of [Gödel numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering). This post is inspired by a question my friend was asked during an interview for Microsoft. 


Gödel numbering was invented by Kurt Gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorems. Consider the alphabet $ \Sigma =\{ a,b,c,d,...,z\} $. Gödel numbering creates a one to one encoding scheme $G: \Sigma^* \to N$, by assigning to each symbol in the alphabet a positive integer $a=1, b=2,...,z=26$ and encodes strings by the product of successive primes raised to these powers.


$$G(x_1x_2...x_n) = 2^{x_1} \cdot 3^{x_2} \cdots p_n^{x_n}$$


So in theory, every string can be expressed as a natural number and every natural number can be broken down into a string by prime factorization. There are some practical limitations here:


 1. The numbers get very large very fast, representing them would be difficult. For example: $G(abcd) = 2 \cdot 9 \cdot 125 \cdot 2401 = 5402250$
 2. Integer Factorization is very difficult for large numbers. There is no efficient, non-quantum integer factorization algorithm for integer factorization. Moreover, it is not known exactly which complexity classes contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem.

Now the problem:

You are given a list of strings , where each string consists only of lower case alphabets. Group these strings into sets of anagrams. For example:


Input : $[abcd,abde,acdb,ebad,bade]$


Output: $[abcd,acdb]$ and $[abde,ebad,bade]$

Solution:
We want strings which are anagrams to have the same $G$ value. Applying the $G$ function directly wont work as it takes into consideration the location of the symbols as well. Ex:$G(ab)=18$ and $G(ba)=12$.

Consider this example: $aaaaabbbbb,ababababab, aabbaabbab$. These three strings are anagrams, all such anagrams could be represented as the multi-set $\{a:5,b:5\}$ . We need to design a function which would map from the set of multi-sets of $\{a,b,c,..z\}$ to $N$

Instead of assigning the values $1,2,3,4,...,26$, lets assign the values $2,3,5,7,...,p_{26}$ to $a,b,c,d,...,z$ respectively. So $\{a:5,b:5\}=2^5\cdot3^5=7776$

The new $G$ function we are using is this:

$$
G(x) = 2^{ \#a} \cdot 3^{ \#b} \cdot 5^{ \#c} \cdots p_{26}^{\#z}
$$

Where $\#a$ represents the number of $a$s in $x$.

Given a string $x_1x_2...x_n$, $G(x_1x_2...x_n)$ can be calculated in a single pass through the string as:

$$G(x_1x_2...x_n) = V[x_1]\cdot V[x_2] \cdots V[x_n]$$

Where $V[x]$ is the value assigned to the alphabet $x$, in this case $p_x$.

Considering the original example,  $[abcd,abde,acdb,ebad,bade]$.
applying the $G$ function to each string in this array we get $[120,144,120,144,120]$.  The strings having the same $G$ function value will be anagrams and they can be put in the respective sets in linear time.

A concise implementation in python would look like this:

    from operator import mul
	from collections import defaultdict
	primes=[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101]
	alphabets='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

	Values= dict(zip(alphabets, primes))

	def G(s):
		L = [Values[i] for i in s]
		return reduce(mul, L, 1)

	L=['abcd','abde','acdb','ebad','bade']
	V=[G(s) for s in L]


	d=defaultdict(list)
	for v,l in zip(V,L):
		d[v].append(l)

	print d.items()
	# [(210, ['abcd', 'acdb']), (462, ['abde', 'ebad', 'bade'])]
