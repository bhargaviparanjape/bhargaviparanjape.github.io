title: Randomized Binary Search Trees

This post will be about using Randomization for constructing [Binary Search Trees (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) whose expected height would be $$O(\log n)$$.
There are several ways to construct height balanced BSTs. Popular methods taught in undergraduate curriculum are [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) and [Red-Black Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)
