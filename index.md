# Hi There!
My name is Sudeep Raja. I just graduted from the **[Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)** with a **Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science an Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/)**. I have worked as a research intern at **[IBM Research India](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/)** and at **[Centre for Visual Information Technology](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hydearabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)**.

I aspire to become a researcher working in Computer Science. I am interested to work in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Optimization and Approximation and Randomized Algorithms. My work so far was mostly on application of Deep Neural Networks for problems on Computer Vision, specifically for Activity recognition in videos. I have briefly worked on the P-Median problem in application to Ambulance facility location.
