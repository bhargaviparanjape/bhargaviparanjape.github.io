# Hi There!
I am a **[Budding Scientist](http://www.xrci.xerox.com/xerox-budding-scientists)** at **[Conduent Labs India]( "http://indialabs.conduent.com/")****[Xerox Research Center India](http://www.xrci.xerox.com/)**. I graduted from the **[Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)** with a **Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/)** in 2016. I have worked as a research intern at **[IBM Research India](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/)** and at **[Centre for Visual Information Technology](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hydearabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)**. 
You can find my CV here :[CV](http://sudeepraja.github.io/CV.pdf)

I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Armed Bandits, Machine Learning Theory and Optimization. At Xerox, I work on Exploration Strategies and Non Parametric Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning. I have worked on application of Deep Neural Networks for problems on Computer Vision, specifically for Activity recognition in videos. I have briefly worked on the P-Median problem in application to Ambulance facility location. 

I blog about curious things I encounter while reading books or while on the internet. These are things mostly related to the topics mentioned above and some mathematics as well.
