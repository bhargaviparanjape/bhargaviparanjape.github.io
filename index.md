## Hello!
I am a **[Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)** at **[Microsoft Research India]( "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/")**. I graduted from the **[Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)** with a **Bachelor of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/)** in 2016. My [Resume](http://bhargaviparanjape.github.io/documents/CV.pdf).

My research interests lie in the areas of Natural Langauge Processing, Information Retreival, Text Mining, Sociolinguistics and Machine Learning.

At IIT Kharagpur, I worked on the compuational study of Clikbait Journalism in Online News and the evolution of Social Movements in Online Social Networks.

At Microsoft Research, I have worked on numerous projects, notably:

- Expedition for Machine Learning algorithms for Resource Constrained Devices
- Task Specific Document Expansion using Alternating Minimization
- Learning Sparse Document Embeddings for Text Classification and Information Retrieval
- Robust Psudeo-Relevance Feedback for Information Retrieval using Structured Learning.
- Bilingual Word Embeddings for Cross-lingual Text Classification and Cross-lingual Information Retreival
<!-- - Rationalizing predictions of deep neural models, including sequence-to-sequence models. -->
