I am a **[Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)** at **[Microsoft Research India]( "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/")**. I graduted from the **[Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)** with a **Bachelor of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/)** in 2016. My [Resume](http://bhargaviparanjape.github.io/documents/CV.pdf).
I am a 1st year PhD student at **[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz). I am interested in question answering, explaining neural models and pre-training. I have an MS in Language Technology from CMU and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.
